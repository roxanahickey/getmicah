I am a microbial ecologist broadly interested in the diversity, function and dynamics of microbial communities. I am currently a postdoc working with Dr. Jessica Green in the Biology and the Built Environment Center at the University of Oregon, where I am researching microbial relationships between human health and the built environment.
